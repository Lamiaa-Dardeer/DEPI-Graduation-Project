## Problem Statement

This repository hosts a Power BI project analyzing 21 years of electric outage data across the U.S. power grid, spanning from January 2002 to July 2023. The analysis, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), aims to uncover outage trends, assess their impacts, and provide recommendations for enhancing grid performance and resilience.
The project leverages Power BI for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization, creating an engaging and insightful narrative to explore outage trends, identify vulnerabilities, and evaluate their effects on customers and energy demand.



 # Steps followed 
- ## Data Cleaning : 
•	Removed duplicates and irrelevant rows for a cleaner dataset.
•	Standardized column formats, values, and ensured consistency.
•	Categorized outage events and maintained data integrity.

- ## Data Modeling & Calculations : 
•	Established relationships between tables to build a structured data model.
•	Developed DAX measures for key metrics, including event counts, averages, and year-over-year (YOY) comparisons

- ## Visualization : 
•	Designed visuals to highlight trends, patterns, and key metrics.
•	Emphasized outliers and anomalies for deeper insights.

- ## Distribution & Automation : 
•	Published reports on Power BI Online for accessibility.
•	Automated data refresh schedules to maintain up-to-date insights.

# Project Objectives : 
This project focuses on achieving the following:

1.  Data Cleaning: Consolidating raw outage data and resolving inconsistencies.
2.  Pattern Detection: Identifying trends, anomalies, and recurring outage events.
3. Impact Quantification: Measuring customer disruptions and demand losses due to outages.
4. Vulnerability Analysis: Highlighting weak points in the grid and proposing actionable recommendations.
5. Interactive Visualization: Presenting insights via a user-friendly Power BI dashboard.
